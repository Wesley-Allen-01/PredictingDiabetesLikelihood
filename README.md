# PredictingDiabetesLikelihood
Wesley Allen and Jaden Snell

This project aims to build predictive models to determine the likelihood of developing diabetes based on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. 
The project will utilize several machine learning algorithms including linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, neural networks, support vector machines, 
random forests, and boosted decision trees. The ultimate goal is to identify the most accurate and efficient predictive model for this dataset.
